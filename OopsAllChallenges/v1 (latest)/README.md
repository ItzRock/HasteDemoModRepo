This mod turns all of the default levels into challenge levels.

I made this mod a bit differently than you're supposed to so you have to install it differently.

In order to install, simply copy the assembly.dll file.
In steam go to Haste and select Manage -> Browse Local Files
Then Go to Haste_Data -> Managed 
Finally, just paste the dll file.
